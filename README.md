# project-elfenroads
A Unity replication of the boardgame Elfenroads
<br>
Working in a group of 6, this was a year-long school project where we replicated the boardgame of Elfenroads, along with its expansion Elfengold within a Unity multiplayer game.
<br>
If you would like to try the game, unfortunately the game requires access to a school-provided lobby service which is now inaccessible, so instead I will provide a video of my fellow group member Jack's demo of the game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0uCBVm1_zU&ab_channel=JackDrolet
